/**
 * Common interface for requests made on elements in an asynchronous viewer. Results
 * of a request are reported to a request monitor asynchronously (usually a
 * specialization of this interface). An request may be cancelled by the client
 * making the request, or by the adapter fulfilling the request.
 * Adapters may report failure by setting an appropriate status on this monitor. When a request
 * is complete, an adapter must call <code>done()</code> on the monitor, no matter
 * if the update succeeded or failed. The <code>done()</code> method does not need to be
 * called if a request is canceled.
 * <p>
 * Operations accepting a request monitor are expected to poll the
 * monitor (using <code>isCanceled</code>) periodically and abort at their
 * earliest convenience.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.
 * </p>
