/**
 * Describes a change within a model. A delta is a hierarchical description of a change
 * within a model. It constists of a path of nodes. Each node references an element
 * from a model, and desribes how that element changed.
 * <p>
 * An element can be added, removed, or changed. As well, its possible that an element
 * did not change, but that one of its children changed. When an element changes, an 
 * additional information describes the change. For example, and element's content may have
 * changed (its children), or its state may have changed.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Optionally, an update action is provided with a node. A node may be expanded
 * or selected.
